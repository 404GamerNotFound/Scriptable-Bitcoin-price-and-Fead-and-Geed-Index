# Bitcoin Price and Fear & Greed Index Widget for Scriptable

This Scriptable widget provides a quick view of the current Bitcoin price and the Crypto Fear & Greed Index, designed for iOS devices. The Bitcoin price is fetched from the Coindesk API, and the Fear & Greed Index is retrieved from the Alternative.me API. The widget also color-codes the Fear & Greed Index for intuitive visualization: green indicates greed, and red indicates fear.

- **Fear & Greed Index**: Shows the current state of the market sentiment by displaying the Fear & Greed Index. The index value changes the color of the displayed text â€” green for greed and red for fear.

3. Run the script to view the widget or add it to your home screen for regular updates.
